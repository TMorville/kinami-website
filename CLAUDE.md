# Kinami Website

## Project Structure

- `pages/07d-thalweg-amber-card-2.html` — the main (and only active) page
- `.interface-design/system.md` — design system: tokens, type scale, spacing, surfaces, animation, component patterns. Reference this before building or modifying any UI.
- `archive/` — old exploration files and screenshots. Ignore this folder entirely; it is not part of the active project.
- `history/` — AI-generated planning/design docs

## Design

Single-hue amber on near-black. All colors are `rgba(220, 180, 100, alpha)` at varying opacities. No secondary hue. See `.interface-design/system.md` for the full token system, type scale, and component patterns.
